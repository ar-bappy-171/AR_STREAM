Task: Fix Feature #7 - Season & Episode Tracker not showing in DetailModal

Work Log:
- Discovered EpisodeTracker component existed at src/components/ar-stream/EpisodeTracker.tsx but was never imported or rendered
- Storage functions (getWatchProgress, updateWatchProgress, updateWatchTotals) were already in place
- Added import for EpisodeTracker in DetailModal.tsx
- Added EpisodeTracker rendering in the content body section (after Details Grid, before Where to Watch)
- Tracker only shows for TV/anime content types (movies return null from EpisodeTracker)
- Added smart UX: when content is TV/anime but NOT in watchlist, shows a "Track your progress" prompt with "Add to List" button
- When content IS in watchlist, shows full EpisodeTracker with season/episode steppers, progress bar, and quick actions
- Handled anime case: uses episodes field as totalEpisodes with 1 season as fallback

Stage Summary:
- EpisodeTracker now visible inside DetailModal for TV/anime content
- Smart prompt shown when not in watchlist, full tracker when in list

Task: Fix EpisodeTracker bug - season change resets episode count to zero + UX improvements

Work Log:
- Root cause: totalEpisodes was a flat number across ALL seasons, not per-season. When switching seasons, episode stepper max stayed at grand total (e.g. 50) instead of per-season count (e.g. 10)
- Added SeasonInfo type to store.ts with seasonNumber, name, episodeCount, airDate
- Added seasonEpisodeCounts field to WatchListItem in storage.ts (Record<string, number>)
- Added updateSeasonEpisodeCounts() and getSeasonEpisodeCounts() storage functions
- Updated DetailModal to extract seasons array from TMDB API response and pass to EpisodeTracker
- Completely redesigned EpisodeTracker with:
  - Season pill/tab selector (visual tabs for each season with completion checkmarks)
  - Per-season episode count from TMDB data (not flat total)
  - Episode stepper with minus/plus buttons and clear "X / Y" display
  - Season-specific progress bar with percentage
  - Overall progress bar for multi-season shows (total watched / total episodes)
  - 3 action buttons: Next Episode, Complete Season, Complete Show
  - Smart status badges: "All Done!", "Season Complete", "S1E5"
  - Fallback: evenly distributes episodes across seasons if TMDB season data unavailable

Stage Summary:
- Bug fixed: season change now correctly shows per-season episode count
- UX significantly improved with visual season tabs, dual progress bars, and clear actions
- Per-season data persisted in localStorage via seasonEpisodeCounts
- Lint clean, compiles successfully

Task ID: 4
Agent: Main Coordinator
Task: Fix 7 preview panel issues (console errors/warnings)

Work Log:
- Fixed EpisodeTracker: useMemo with side effect (updateSeasonEpisodeCounts) → useEffect
- Fixed EpisodeTracker: moved updateWatchTotals from useState initializer into useEffect (no side effects during render)
- Fixed AIRecommendations: added missing required sectionId prop to ContentRow (2 places)
- Fixed DashboardSection: replaced useMemo(() => getWatchList(), []) with useState lazy initializer + typeof window guard
- Fixed ActivityTimeline: same useState pattern replacing useMemo localStorage reads
- Fixed ExportImportSection: same useState pattern replacing useMemo localStorage reads
- Fixed WatchListSection: replaced broken IIFE using getWatchProgress (which returned no totalEpisodes) with getWatchList lookup that includes totalEpisodes
- Fixed DetailModal: added null check for nextEpisodeToAir.air_date (could create Invalid Date)
- Fixed DetailModal: genre key now has fallback for undefined id/mal_id
- Fixed TrailerPreview: added typeof window guard for window.innerWidth/innerHeight
- Fixed PiPPlayer: kept useState lazy initializer with typeof window guard in getInitialPosition

Stage Summary:
- All 7+ runtime issues fixed
- Lint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Dev server compiles successfully
- Hydration mismatches resolved via proper typeof window guards in useState initializers
- Side effects removed from render phase (useMemo/useState initializer)

Task: Fix color theme not working + sidebar not scrollable + integrate OMDb API

Work Log:
- Fixed CSS selectors: `.dark [data-theme="ocean"]` → `.dark[data-theme="ocean"]` (no space = same element match)
- Made color themes more impactful: now changes 7+ CSS variables (--ars, --primary, --ring, --sidebar-primary, --chart-1, --chart-5)
- Added both light and dark mode specific overrides for each theme
- Fixed ThemeSelector: added useEffect for applying data-theme to DOM, added theme descriptions, color dot indicator
- Added inline script in layout.tsx to apply theme before React hydration (prevent flash)
- Fixed sidebar scrollability: added `min-h-0` to ScrollArea (fixes flexbox min-height: auto preventing scroll)
- Integrated OMDb API (key: 20ccc009): created proxy route at /api/omdb/[...path]/route.ts
- Enhanced DetailModal with OMDb ratings section: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic with colored badges
- Added OMDb additional info: MPAA Rating (Rated), Awards, Box Office
- Fixed missing lucide icon: Tomato → Apple (Tomato doesn't exist in lucide-react)

Stage Summary:
- Color themes now work correctly in both light and dark mode
- Sidebar is scrollable — lower tabs (Dashboard, Activity, Settings, Live TV) are accessible
- OMDb API integrated with ratings display in DetailModal
